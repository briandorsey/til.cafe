# TIL = Today I Learned

Hi!

I'm Brian Dorsey... and this is my website.

Imagine a relaxed cafe where folks are hanging out, working on projects and
sharing what they've learned recently. This site is where I'm sharing public
notes, things I've learned recently, project updates, etc. 

Hopefully you find some of it helpful and use it to do something important to you. 

Take care,

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-Brian

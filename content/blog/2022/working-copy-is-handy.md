If you use git and have an iOS device, check it out: [https://workingcopy.app](https://workingcopy.app)

It works on both phones and iPads, has an embedded editor and supports several methods of integrations with other applications. I've mostly used it for small updates, but it seems to have enough features to support even complex workflows.

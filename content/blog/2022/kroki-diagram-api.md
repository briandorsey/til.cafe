[Kroki](https://kroki.io) is an API and interactive web site which creates diagrams from text.
<!-- more -->

I've used `GraphVis` for years... `Kroki` supports `GraphVis's` `dot` format, and *many* more formats. Most of them I'd never heard of, so if you like text --> diagram tools, it's worth looking at even for that alone. `Bytefield` visualizes binary formats. Several UML formats. and `Excalidraw`! 

They also have an interactive demo on the main page.

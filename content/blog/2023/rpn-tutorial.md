RPN: Reverse Polish Notation. Or postfix notation or stack logic, the calculator logic system used in many Hewlett-Packard (HP) calculators.

I'd heard of and slightly poked at RPN calculators a few times in the past. Not sure why, but I gave them another look recently and this tutoral made them finally *click* for me. It's very good. If you've ever been curious about RPN or HP calculators, give it a look. It also includes links to many simulators. Also useful if you're an RPN person trying to get someone else into them. :)
